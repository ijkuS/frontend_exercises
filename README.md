# Mini Projects & Exercises - WIP 
A collection of practical frontend development exercises, currently a work in progress.

As I explored different ways to efficiently organize small projects and exercises, 
I debated between using a monorepo or multirepo structure. After some research, 
the article below helped me make my decision. I opted for a monorepo to streamline my workflow, 
allowing me to create a cohesive structure that organizes links to various files, 
while making it easier to manage all the exercises and projects I have developed.
